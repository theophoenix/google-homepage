# google-homepage

This project is from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com) (Web Development 101 >> The Front End >> Project: HTML/CSS) and involves building the [Google](https://www.google.com) homepage to practice using HTML and CSS.

- [x] Easy Version: Build the Google.com homepage  
- [x] Difficult Version (optional): Build the Google.com search results page

## Skills Demonstrated

### HTML

* Utilised `<div>` tags to divide the page up into smaller sections, and then divide those sections into smaller sections.
  * Recognised the excess use of `<div>` tags. Read about [HTML5 Semantic Elements](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp) to use in the future.
* Implemented a nonfunctioning, stylised `<form>` for aesthetic purposes.
* Introduced to [Scalable Vector Graphics](https://www.w3schools.com/graphics/svg_intro.asp). Used `<svg>` to include small inline images alongside text.
* Used a `<table>` for pagination that included images.

### CSS

* Manipulated text using `color`, `text-align`, `text-decoration`, and `vertical-align`.
* Demonstrated a working knowledge of the [Box Model](https://www.w3schools.com/Css/css_boxmodel.asp) using `height`, `width`, `margin`, `padding`, `border`, and `box-shadow`.
* Used `.class` and `#id` selectors, and the psuedo-selector `:hover`.
  * Struggled to keep the CSS file organised, and recognised classes were being used inefficiently. Took notes on CSS organisation.
* Styled the pages using `background`, `font`, and positioning properties `top`, `right`, `bottom`, `left`, `display`, `position`, `float`, and `overflow`.
